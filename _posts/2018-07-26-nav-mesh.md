Today I implemented routing.  
First I tried AStar. Problem with voxel AStar is, units can only move at 45 degrees, and for me it doesn't look great.  
Then I found out about Nav Mesh.  
Nav mesh is a simplified mesh, usually baked, used for navigation purposes. It consists of convex polygons only, so units can move freely within the polygons in a straight line. Polygons are then linked in a graph, and game can AStar through the polygons, essentially.

Looks great:
